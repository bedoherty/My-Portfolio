## My Portfolio

Built this site to demonstrate my ability to be a pretty okay developer.

## Deployment

This repo is tracked via bitrise, which pulls and builds the react js code into a production bundle and deploys it to an ubuntu droplet on DigitalOcean via the following scheme:

master -> http://bedoherty.com

dev -> http://dev.bedoherty.com

## Future Goals

* Pull live data from github/medium/LinkedIn/etc.
* Fix hacky code for the header scrolling
* Add mobile web support.
